# MathLang Compiler

MathLang is a programming language designed for mathematical expressions and computations. This repository contains the source code for the MathLang compiler, which translates MathLang code into bytecode for execution on a virtual machine.

_This project is still a work in progress. If you are interested in contributing or collaborating, please feel free to reach out or submit a pull request._

# Current features
1. **Bytecode Compiler**: MathLang features a bytecode compiler that translates MathLang code into bytecode for execution on a virtual machine.

2. **Virtual Machine**: The bytecode generated by the compiler is executed on the MathLang Virtual Machine (MLVM), providing a runtime environment for MathLang programs.

3. **Arithmetic Expressions**: MathLang supports the basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

4. **Supported Literals**: MathLang currently only supports the following literals:

	- Integer Literals: Whole numbers without decimal points
	- Real Literals: Numbers with decimal points

5. **Built-in Operators**: The language comes with built-in operators for arithmetic operations:
	- Addition: `+` (binary and unary),
	- Subtraction: `-` (binary and unary),
	- Multiplication: `*`  (binary),
	- Division: `/`  (binary),
	- Exponentiation: `^`  (binary),
	- Print: `print`  (unary)

	and more. These operators can be overloaded or extended (a planned features).

6. **Variable Declaration**: MathLang allows you to declare variables using the `let` keyword followed by the variable type and identifier. Optionally, you can initialize the variable with an expression using the `:=` operator.

	Syntax:

		let <type> <identifier>;
	or,

		let <type> <identifier> := <expression>;

<!--7. **Variable Assignment**: MathLang allows you to assign values to variables using the `=` operator.-->

7. **Functions**: MathLang allows you to define functions using the `define` keyword followed by the function name, parameter list, and return type. Optionally, you can specify the return type using the `->` operator (the type will be `none` if not specified).

	Syntax:

		define <name> (<param-list>) [-> <return-type>] {...}

	You can use the `return` keyword to return from a non-returning function. As for returning functions, you can use the `:->` operator to return a value from the function.

	Syntax:

		return;
	or,

		:-> <return-value>;

_Note: Function overloading is not supported yet. This feature is planned for future versions of MathLang. The same applies to default parameters._

8. **Function Calls**: MathLang allows you to call functions using the function name and followed by a parameter list encapsulated in parentheses.

	Syntax:

		<name>(<param-list>);

8. **Comments**: MathLang supports single-line comments only for now.

	Syntax:

		// single-line comment
	
# Future Features
## REPL
A Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) is in development. It will provide an interactive environment for users to experiment with MathLang code, execute expressions, and receive immediate feedback.

## More literal types
Future versions of MathLang will introduce more literal types, expanding the language's support for various data types.

- Strings
- Boolean

## Conditional Statements
Conditional statements, such as `If` and `Else`, will be introduced to enable branching based on logical conditions.

Syntax:

	If [<condition1>] {...}
	Else If [<condition2>] {...}
	...
	Else {...}

## Classes and MathObjs
Classes and MathObjs is a planned feature in MathLang that will introduce object-oriented programming capabilities to the language. With this feature, users will be able to define classes, create objects, and perform operations on those objects using methods and properties. This will enable users to organize their code into reusable and modular components, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## User-Defined Operators
MathLang will also allow users to define their own operators, that are at most four characters long, with custom behavior. This feature will provide flexibility and extensibility to the language, allowing developers to create domain-specific operators or redefine existing operators.

## Symbolic Expressions
Symbolic Expressions is an upcoming feature in MathLang that allows users to manipulate mathematical expressions symbolically, rather than numerically. With this feature, users will be able to work with variables, constants, and mathematical operations to create and manipulate complex mathematical expressions.
