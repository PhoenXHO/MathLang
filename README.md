# MathLang Compiler

MathLang is a programming language designed for mathematical expressions and computations. This repository contains the source code for the MathLang compiler, which translates MathLang code into bytecode for execution on a virtual machine.

_This project is still a work in progress. If you are interested in contributing or collaborating, please feel free to reach out or submit a pull request._

# Current features
1. **Bytecode Compiler**: MathLang features a bytecode compiler that translates MathLang code into bytecode for execution on a virtual machine.

2. **Virtual Machine**: The bytecode generated by the compiler is executed on the MathLang Virtual Machine (MLVM), providing a runtime environment for MathLang programs.

3. **Arithmetic Expressions**: MathLang supports the basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

4. **Supported Literals**: MathLang currently only supports the following literals:

	- Integer Literals: Whole numbers without decimal points
	- Real Literals: Numbers with decimal points

5. **Built-in Operators**: The language comes with built-in operators for arithmetic operations:
	- Addition: `+` (binary and unary),
	- Subtraction: `-` (binary and unary),
	- Multiplication: `*`  (binary),
	- Division: `/`  (binary),
	- Exponentiation: `^`  (binary),
	- Print: `print`  (unary)

	and more. These operators can be overloaded or extended (a planned features).
	
# Future Features
## More literal types
Future versions of MathLang will introduce more literal types, expanding the language's support for various data types.

- Strings
- Boolean

## Variable Declaration
Future versions of MathLang will support variable declaration, allowing users to declare and initialize variables with specific types.

Syntax:

	let <type> <identifier>;
or,

	let <type> <identifier> := <expression>;

## Conditional Statements
Conditional statements, such as `If` and `Else`, will be introduced to enable branching based on logical conditions.

Syntax:

	If [<condition1>] {...}
	Else If [<condition2>] {...}
	...
	Else {...}

## User-Defined Functions
Users will be able to define their own functions with custom logic.

Syntax:

	define <identifier>(<type> param1, ...) -> <type>;
